# carbon-flux
simple calculations of POC flux to the ocean bottom based on satellite productivity estimates

-----------------------------------

## background from FMK
Nearly 20 years ago we did some simple calculations of POC flux to the ocean bottom based on satellite productivity estimates

I’d like to revive the program we had to do that – this was started by Haiying and then taken over by Remi Luerssen. Tylar had found Remy’s directories that should have the code (likely IDL)


Can we revive this calculation, using the new NPP satellite data from OSU? I would suggest using the Eppley curve modality of NPP, perhaps tweak the carbon flux parameterization with new models if any (like Colleen Mouw, even though I think that makes no difference at the bottom)
